## Projects

### Hand Tracking and Gesture Recognition
This project focuses on the development of a real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition system, designed to enable interaction with a computer within a defined interaction area. The system recognizes four primary gestures: Point, Pinch, Open Hand, and Swipe.

The project also includes studies on the effectiveness of Computer Vision and Machine Learning in achieving accurate gesture recognition.
