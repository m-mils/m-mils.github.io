## Projects

### Hand Tracking and Gesture Recognition
![](assets/img/ar_interaction_img.png)

This project involved the design and implementation of a real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition system for natural interaction within a defined workspace. The system recognizes four gestures: Point, Pinch, Open Hand, and Swipe, making it suitable for applications in Augmented Reality (AR) where controller-free interaction is key.

#### Project Highlights

***System Design***
* Implemented a top-down camera setup capturing hand movements within a calibrated interaction frame.
* Built a pipeline combining Computer Vision (CV) and Machine Learning (ML) approaches for gesture recognition.

***Computer Vision Techniques***
* Applied preprocessing methods (grayscale conversion, histogram equalization, Gaussian blur, bilateral filtering) to improve robustness.
* Used Canny edge detection, contour detection, convex hull, and convexity defect analysis to isolate and analyze hand shape.
* Developed rules based on convex hull angles and line segment lengths to classify gestures (e.g., distinguishing between Open Hand and Pinch).
* Implemented gesture dynamics detection: Swipe was recognized through frame-to-frame displacement of the convex hull.

***Machine Learning Approach***
* Built and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in TensorFlow using a custom dataset of labeled gesture images.
* Model architecture included multiple Conv2D and pooling layers, with a final dense layer for classification into Open Hand, Pinch, and Point.
* Tested different activation functions, with sigmoid performing best for multi-class gesture classification.

#### Results

***Computer Vision:*** Delivered robust gesture recognition and hand tracking, though performance was sensitive to lighting conditions.
***Machine Learning:*** Successfully classified gestures from static images but lacked temporal awareness (e.g., could not detect Swipe).
***Comparative evaluation*** showed that CV was more reliable for AR integration, while ML offered strong potential when combined with better datasets.
